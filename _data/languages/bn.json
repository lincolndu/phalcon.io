The site was re-launched on a new platform in the beginning of January, 2013 and has since shown steady growth. Current daily visits:  ~1500 unique visitors, ~5000 page views. The site is running on an old physical server 1хP4-3Ghz, 4GB RAM. Once again, thank you for a great framework and all what you are doing: ).",

Both sites work on single RESTful-like API written on Phalcon\\Mvc\\Micro. On peak loads API processes something like 400 req/sec and this is not a limit.
